How about a fiery spicy chili to turn up the heat and make a bold statement? It's full of flavor and can be made very hot if desired. Here's a recipe for a Fiery Chili that\u2019s sure to make an impression:\n\n## Fiery Spicy Chili\n\nA bold, intensely spicy chili packed with robust flavors and plenty of heat to leave an impression.\n\n### Ingredients\n* 500 grams (1 lb) ground beef or turkey\n* 1 large onion, chopped (about 150 grams / 5.3 oz)\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2-3 fresh chili peppers (such as Thai or jalape\u00f1o), minced (adjust to taste)  \n* 400 grams (14 oz) canned diced tomatoes\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* 1 can (400 grams / 14 oz) kidney beans, drained and rinsed\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust based on heat preference)\n* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (for extra heat)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n* Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n* Sour cream or yogurt (optional, to soothe the heat)\n\n### Instructions\n1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n2. Add the ground beef or turkey to the pot, breaking it apart with a spoon, and cook until browned all over, about 8 minutes.\n3. While the meat is cooking, mince the chili peppers finely (wear gloves if desired). Add the minced chili peppers to the pot along with smoked paprika, cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Stir well to coat the meat and vegetables with the spices.\n4. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes to deepen the flavors.\n5. Pour in the diced tomatoes and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n6. About 10 minutes before the chili is done, add the kidney beans and stir well. Continue simmering uncovered if you'd like it thicker.\n7. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more chili or cayenne if you want it spicier.\n8. Serve hot, garnished with chopped cilantro and a dollop of sour cream or yogurt if desired.\n\n### Tips\n- For maximum heat, use dried chili flakes or hot sauce in addition to fresh chilies.\n- Serve with crusty bread or over rice for a hearty, spicy meal.\n- To make it ultra-spicy, add a splash of hot sauce or more cayenne pepper before serving.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a milder version or a different fiery dish!"}]}}
