5. Sift the flour and salt into the batter, gently fold until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
6. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are firm but the center remains soft and slightly molten.
8. While baking, prepare serving plates and optional accompaniments.
9. Remove the ramekins from the oven and let sit for 1 minute. Carefully invert each onto a serving plate, gently tapping the ramekin if needed to release the cake.
10. Dust with powdered sugar and add fresh berries or whipped cream if desired. Serve immediately for the best gooey experience.

### Tips
* For an extra touch, add a small piece of chocolate or a caramel center before baking.
* If you prefer different chocolates, dark, milk, or bittersweet work well.
